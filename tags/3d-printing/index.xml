      <title>MPCNC - Printing and X-Y Assembly</title>

      <description>When I last posted, I had just begun printing the pieces for the Mostly Printed CNC machine. Now, about 120 machine hours and several hours of assembly later, it&amp;rsquo;s time for an update!
Printing and Reprinting Each part was printed at 55% infill, with 3 perimeters, and at 55mm/s. That was a little fast, and resulted in some ringing in the print features, but the parts didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be pretty, just accurate and functional.</description>

      <title>Google Home Mini Wall Mount</title>

      <description>Over Christmas, I took advantage of Google&amp;rsquo;s sale on the Google Home Mini to pick up a few for the apartment. Even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take up a lot of desk space, I wanted to mount it to the wall to keep it off the limited shelf space, and to hear it throughout the room. To resolve this, I came up with the following wall mount. The design started with a few reference images I found online.</description>

      <title>Ikea Lamp to Camera Mount</title>

      <description>At less than $10, the Tertial lamp from Ikea is my favorite source of workspace illumination. So far, I have one in the garage over my workbench, and one over the desk in my office. They are easy to move into place, and will hold fast when let go. For the price, this lamp can&amp;rsquo;t be beat. The mechanics of these lamps is also interesting. Forces and torques are balanced through the weight of the lamp and counter-acting springs.</description>

      <title>Scanning Bones for 3D Printing</title>

      <description>In collaboration with my university&amp;rsquo;s anthropology department, I had the opportunity to scan skeleton fragments with the intent to 3d print copies. Yesterday, I finally got a sample scanned and printed.
I placed the skull fragment on the rotating platform of a NextEngine 3d scanner, giving a full 360 degree view of the object. I did this twice at different orientations, and used the scanner software to fuse the scans together.</description>

      <title>Printrbot Simple Metal Upgrade</title>

      <description>Though I received it weeks ago, I finally got a chance to install the x-axis upgrade for my Printrbot. I now have 4 more inches in the x direction, and a heated build plate.
I also installed a new Ubis13 hotend to replace the offbrand E3DV6 that leaked all over the place. This required printing a new fan mount, which you can see coming off the hotend in the picture. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to printing with new materials and making use of the extra space.</description>

      <title>Reviving an Old Powderbed Printer</title>

      <description>A little over a year ago, our group acquired this old ZCorp 310 printer from surplus. This machine uses powderbed technology, where an inkjet deposits liquid binder on a plaster material, fusing it together into a solid object. This brand of printer is rarely seen nowadays, since the company is now owned by 3D Systems. With no material, no accessories, and no software, we were unsure if it was even functional.</description>

      <title>Filament Extrusion</title>

      <description>Despite the wide range of available thermoplastics, sometimes spools of filament with desirable electromagnetic or mechanical properties are not commercially available. For this reason, our research group acquired a Filabot filament extruder. Pellets of thermoplastic are loaded in through the hopper, and pushed through a heating element via an auger. The nozzles are bolts with different sized holes for 3 mm and 1.75 mm filament.
Today I got a chance to make some filament.</description>

      <title>Laser Mount for Classroom Use</title>

      <description>A friend of mine was in need of a set of cheap lasers for a class he was teaching on optics. Instead of using enclosed laser pointers that ran on obscure button cell batteries, he decided to purchase laser diodes and wire them for connection to a benchtop power supply. This allows for a more hands-on approach for the students, getting them more involved in the projects they are working on.</description>

      <title>CT Scan to STL</title>

      <description>Recently, I have been reading on 3d printing in the medical field. The ability to go beyond a screen allows for visualization and practice of surgery without the patient having to go under the knife. A friend was kind enough to get me a copy of her recent CT scan data so I could attempt to get a 3d-printable object out of it. Using the guide found here, I had little trouble extracting the data, generating a model, and exporting it to an STL file.</description>

      <title>New Nozzle Under The Microscope</title>

      <description>I picked up a new hot end for the Printrbot the other day. This one is modeled after the popular E3D V6 hot end, which has an all-metal design. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for, and this inexpensive clone oozed out the top and bottom of the heater block. Lesson learned, buy the official tried-and-true equipment. While I was heating things up to remove the stray PLA, I was able to use one of the microscopes in the lab to check out the new 0.</description>

      <title>Silicon Cell Print</title>

      <description>For a demonstration piece, I was sent a model of a silicon unit cell to print. This was an enjoyable endeavor, and lead to an interesting discovery in the post-processing procedure on the Form1+
I ended up printing two of these. One was left in the alcohol bath for 2 days, and when removed, was extremely flexible. While I need to be careful with the timing, the flex should make it more resistant to cracking, especially if the unit cell is being passed around during a demonstration.</description>

      <description>The other day, I was tasked with 3d printing a logo from a nearby company. The design was a simple compass with a superimposed letter &amp;ldquo;e.&amp;rdquo; Being such a simple design, I decided to model it directly in AutoDesk Inventor.
Overall, I am happy with the way the logo turned out. This piece had the biggest footprint of anything I&amp;rsquo;ve printed so far. Because of the large area of contact between the piece and the bed, as well as the sharp corners, the first few prints were subject to quite a bit of warping.</description>

      <title>Soda Cap</title>

      <description>A close friend works at a nearby bee farm, assembling and packing various products to ship out. This manufacturing involves a lot of dust floating around the production floor, and he asked if I could print something that would snap over his soda can to keep the stray particles out. I figured this was a perfect opportunity to practice some 3d CAD and get the printer going.
I intended the first version to simply rotate around the top of the can, protecting the hole from dust.</description>

      <title>3d Scanner - MATLAB</title>

      <description>For a project in my computational physics class, I wanted to create something more than a program. With an old webcam, a pantry turntable, and a cheap laser, I figured I could use MATLAB&amp;rsquo;s image processing abilities to create proof-of-concept 3d scanner.
By centering the object on the turntable, and projecting the laser line onto the object, I can use the camera to collect images while rotating the object at known intervals.</description>

      <description>Here is my newly assembled Printrbot Simple Metal. I ordered the printer as a kit, and assembled it this past weekend. So far, it has proven to be a robust machine. Here is a time lapse of the build:

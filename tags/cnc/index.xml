      <description>When I last posted, I had just begun printing the pieces for the Mostly Printed CNC machine. Now, about 120 machine hours and several hours of assembly later, it&amp;rsquo;s time for an update!
Printing and Reprinting Each part was printed at 55% infill, with 3 perimeters, and at 55mm/s. That was a little fast, and resulted in some ringing in the print features, but the parts didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be pretty, just accurate and functional.</description>

      <description>Over the next month or two, I will build the Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC), as found on the website v1engineering.com. It is a CNC platform that can be assembled out of inexpensive electronics and hardware, EMT conduit, and 3d printed components. Here is a link to the project specifications and build instructions.
This machine can be much more than a typical milling machine: pen plotters, needle cutters, drag knifes, even laser cutting and engraving!</description>

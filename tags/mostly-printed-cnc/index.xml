      <description>Over the next month or two, I will build the Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC), as found on the website v1engineering.com. It is a CNC platform that can be assembled out of inexpensive electronics and hardware, EMT conduit, and 3d printed components. Here is a link to the project specifications and build instructions.
This machine can be much more than a typical milling machine: pen plotters, needle cutters, drag knifes, even laser cutting and engraving!</description>
